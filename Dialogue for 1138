N: What a wonderful day, sun is shining, flowers are blooming. <:-) but Gordon and others keep trying to kill me. >:-(
N: Huh, I’m also near Kevin’s place. :-| I did not notice that. <:-( I wonder what he’s been up to it’s been years. I gotta check up on him. :-)
N: Hold up, is that Bethany? /:-/What’s she doing at Kevin’s house? >:-(
N: I should find someplace to listen and hide. :-| (N hiding in bush to eavesdrop)
Bethany: (knocks on Kevin’s door)
Leo: (opens door) Oh hey Bethany, :-| What are you doing here. :-(
Bethany: Oh, I’m just here to see Kevin, :-) it’s urgent. :-(
Leo: Ok, I will let him know that you’re at the door. :-)
Bethany: Sounds good. :-)
Kevin: LEO, who’s at the door? :-|
Leo: It’s Bethany. :-|
Kevin: What’s she doing here? /:-(
Leo: She wants to talk to you about something, she says it’s urgent. <:-|
Kevin: Ok, let her in. :-|
N: (talks quietly) What’s this, why are Leo and Kevin allowing Bethany to his house. I hope it’s not what I think it is? \:-|
Leo: (shuts door)
Kevin: Hello Bethany, what brings you here. :-)
Bethany: Hello Kevin, it’s been a long time since we’ve last seen each other. :-)
Kevin: It sure has been. <:-)
Bethany: How’s your leg since you last broke it years ago? :-|
Kevin: Well I mean, I can walk but it’s broken, the brace is what I will be using for the rest of my life potentially. <:-(
Leo: Damn bro, that sucks. <:-(
Kevin: Yeah, it is what it is Leo. Nothing I can really do about it. :-|
Leo: What about getting surgery for a new leg? \:-|
Kevin: Be for real, /:-( you think it be possible to do? >:-|
Leo: Just a suggestion. <:-|
Kevin: Ok, my bad. <:-( What are you doing here Bethany. >:-(
Bethany: You know Kevin, Gordon has been worrying about you not showing up. <:-(
Kevin: For reals, /:-( since when does Gordon worry? >:-(
Bethany: Since the times you have not shown up to the bar for the meetings. >:-(
Kevin: Beth, I know Gordon, >:-( he does not worry, he will question but not worry. /:-(
Kevin: Dude has no concerns, >:-( but is that why you came to my house? /:-(
Bethany: Yes, and to see you of course. :-)
Kevin: Really? /:-( I see, well honestly Bethany, I’m getting very tired of Gordon. >:-(
Bethany: I know he can be too much sometimes, :-/ but he needs you to be there for the meeting. :-|
Kevin: What meeting? /:-|
Bethany: You don’t know? :-|
Kevin: Listen if it is about killing N, then I’ve had enough of it. >:-(
N: :-) (cheers quietly)
Bethany: I don’t know Kevin, you don’t really have a choice this time. :-/ Gordon is quite serious with this one. <:-(
Leo: What is Gordon’s concern with killing N anyways, and having Kevin come to the meeting? Can’t y’all just have the meeting without Kevin >:-(
Bethany: It’s not your concern, and no. >:-(
Kevin: No Leo’s right. >:-(
Leo: I have a right to know as Kevin’s business partner? >:-|
Bethany: Leo, you are on a no need to know basis.
>:-(
Leo: Whatever Bethany. >:-/
Kevin: It seems that Gordon is always plotting ways to kill N and y’all are just joining him only to fail. <:-/
Bethany: Yes but if we all have faith, we can take him down. >:-)
Kevin: Bethany, I’m not doing this anymore, and honestly you shouldn’t either. >:-(
Bethany: What makes you say that? \:-(
Kevin: Bethany, honestly that day when you, me, John and Gordon tried to kill N, I felt regrets, <:-( like I was forced against my will to kill my best friend. :-| Ask yourself this, would you do the same if Gordon told you to kill Brittany? >:-(
Bethany: Well no, :-/ but Gordon doesn’t have anything against Brittany, only N. >:-|
Leo: Aha but you said no <:-D.
Kevin: Bethany, honestly you should think about what I said, and not join Gordon ever again. :-/ He will betray y’all eventually, <:-( the dude is very narcissistic. >:-(
N: (talks quietly) That’s what I’ve said. :-|
Bethany: Well Kevin, remember we signed an NDA for Gordon, if you don’t show up to his next meeting he will kill you himself. >:-|
Kevin: Let Gordo do it, <:-| I honestly don’t fucking care anymore. >:-( Don’t be surprised that he will kill y’all eventually :-|
Leo: Facts, like N is a good person. I don’t see anything wrong with him. :-|
Bethany: Leo, you know nothing about him. >:-(
Leo: Yes I do, >:-| dude is a platformer. I’ve seen the dude dodge enemies in seconds to beat the zapdrone in the Parkour Race. >:-) You can’t be mad that he escapes you guys every single time. }:-)
Kevin: I’m just saying Bethany, you’re wasting your time. :-| I’m not doing this. >:-(
Bethany: Ok, I will have to tell Gordon.
Kevin: Come on Bethany don’t tell Gordon about everything we’ve discussed. <:-|
Bethany: What do you want me to say? :-|
Leo: You don’t gotta tell Gordon everything. :-| He’s on a need to know basis with this one. >:-(
Kevin: Just tell him, I will be there. >:-|
Bethany: So you want me to lie. :-/
Kevin: Well, I’m going to tell him myself that I quit. :-|
Bethany: He is not going to excuse that. :-|
Kevin: Come on Beth, <:-| you know how much of a pain in the arse that Gordon is. >:-|
Bethany: Sure, /:-( but so is N. >:-(
Leo: No he’s not, you’re just saying that because N escapes y’all’s easily. >:-( He’s a God. :-)
Kevin: I mean I wouldn’t say he’s a God :-/ but he’s good. :-)
Leo: You know what I meant Kevin. /:-/
Kevin: Yes Leo, I do. :-)
Bethany: Kevin you say that Gordon will betray us but you’ve betrayed Gordon, and N will betray you. >:-(
Bethany: You’ve even betrayed N at one point. >:-(
Leo: But Kevin has made up with N years ago. :-|
Kevin: I know and I’ve told you I’ve regretted it. :-| N has never betrayed me once. <:-| The only reason I tried to kill N at one point was because of that stupid NDA that Gordon made us sign that we had to kill him, >:-( otherwise I’ll die. <:-/ I was being selfish of my own life other than N’s. <:-(
Leo: You had no choice Kevin, don’t  blame yourself. You were forced. <:-(
Kevin: I know Leo, but it was still my fault that I didn’t stand up to Gordon about that time when we were trying to kill N. <:-(
Leo: I hear you. But at least N forgave you, and y’all are friends to this day. <:-)
Kevin: True that, :-) but it does still get me to this day sometimes. <:-(
Leo: I know, but just try not to think about it. <:-|
Kevin: You’re right man, <:-| I’ll try not to. :-)
Bethany: You will regret this Kevin if you keep going down this path of not obeying Gordon. <:-(
Kevin: Obeying Gordon, please. >:-D Kevin: Bethany let me tell you a story, I’ve known N for decades, and he’s one of the only people that I’m still cool with to this day even if we have some disagreements. :-/ He was the person that helped me get into getting out of my comfort zone to try new things like skateboarding. :-) Dude has even helped me get into meditation whenever I’ve went through shit in life. :-( He even suggested that I get a job that would help support my parents and I when we were poor at the time and when we were about to get evicted. <:-(
Leo: Damn, N did all that for you. :-(
Kevin. Yep, and I tried to get him killed when I was a coward at the time and had no idea that a job at the Liquor Bar also required me to kill N. :-(
Kevin: So Bethany, the only reason I worked for Gordon in the first place was to get funds to help my parents and myself. <:-| I will say that he paid well at the time. <:-/ but not now. >:-| But when I realized that I had to sign an NDA, I had no idea what I was getting into but I signed it so I can get the money to do whatever even if it meant going through plans that were required to kill N. :-( I don’t like Gordon one bit, and I know Brittany doesn’t either. >:-(
Bethany: Your parents are still alive? /:-(
Kevin: Yes, and I’ve been trying to get to them since but things are expensive in this world for travel :-(
Bethany: Where are they located. :-(
Kevin: Why do you want to know? What’s your plan. >:-(
Leo: Seriously? /:-/
Bethany: No plans just asking. :-|But damn what a story, I had no idea that Gordon somewhat blackmailed you as you’ve said. <:-(
Kevin: Yes, and he’s a deceiver, he only cares about himself. >:-|
Bethany: Maybe, but he’s serious this time, he’s been selfless letting you go for years. Time is up buddy. |:-|
Kevin: Bethany, I know your friend can’t stand Gordon because everytime we were there, she always gets annoyed by Gordon’s plans to kill N. :-|
Bethany: Well that’s Brittany, she has a lot of anger issues she needs to resolve, and I help her with that. :-(
Kevin: Well as N told me, she should do some meditation. :-( Do you at least want a cup of lemonade or tea? :-|
Bethany: Yes lemonade will do. :-)
Kevin: Ok Leo, can you get Bethany a cup of lemonade from the kitchen. :-)
Leo: Coming right up (20 seconds later) Here you go Bethany, :-) maybe that’ll clear your mind of this Gordon and N feud. :-(
Bethany: (finishes lemonade) Well that’s was good, but I need to go and prepare myself to attend Gordon’s meeting. :-|
Kevin: Ok bye Bethany. :-|
Leo: Yes see you whenever we see you. :-|
N: (talks quietly and leaves Kevin’s premises) Damn well Gordon is a lost cause but I was not expecting Bethany to come to Kevin’s house. I need to prepare myself again.
Leo: Are you really going to tell Gordon that you’ve quit. /:-(
Kevin: Of course not, fuck Gordon. >:-(
Leo: Fair enough :-|
Kevin: I need to call N and tell him that Bethany came to my house to try to convince me to kill him for Gordon. :-(
Leo: Yeah man, your facing a lot of tough decisions. <:-(
Kevin: And who knows, he’ll probably just lure me to the meeting and kill me for not killing N, so there’s no point in me seeing him. :-(
Leo: You’re not wrong. :-(
Kevin: (calls N)
N: Hello? :-|
Kevin: Yo N, it’s Kevin it’s been a long time, can you come to my place, it’s urgent? :-(
N: Sure thing bro, I probably know what it is about, but I gotta head home first and prepare myself again. :-|
Kevin: Ok see you there. (hangs up) :-)
Leo: Ok boss, I’m gonna head out, gotta head back to work and do some other business shit. :-)
Kevin: Ok drive safe Leo. :-)
Leo: Thanks Kevin, take care. :-)
Kevin: (sighs) Oh Gordon, sometimes I don’t understand you. |:-| Sending Bethany to try to convince me to join you. >:-( I hope N doesn’t think I’m trying to stab him in the back again. :-( Nah, I don’t think so. :-D But anyways, I’m gonna go to sleep, I’m tired as fuck. :-/ I’m going to stop talking to myself now. :-(
