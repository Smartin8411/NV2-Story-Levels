N: Dude, I can tell by your facial expressions that you’re not satisfied working for Gordon. |:-( You can tell me, I’m not gonna say shit. /:-(
Brick: Yeah right. >:-(
N: What am I going to say to Gordon, dude literally hates me for no apparent reason. >:-(
Brick: Let’s just say that he can be a bit too much in his plans to kill you, <:-| which I support. ):-)
N: Do you really? /:-|
Brick: Yes, :-( but I’m not going to say much. >:-(
N: Trust me bro I don’t need you to say much, /:-( I already got your input of what you thought of Gordon :-)
Brick: Ok, … AND? /:-|
N: And, I know y’all are tired of Gordon, |:-| especially Brittany with her obnoxious attitude, /:-( but y’all are too afraid to admit it because y’all know I’m right, /:-) and y’all afraid that Gordon will kill y’all if you decline this request to kill me. (:-)
Brick: Whatever you say dude. /:-(
N: Brick you know I’m right, think about the amount of times I’ve escaped yalls, |:-) you can join my side. <:-) Gordon will betray you eventually, just you watch. >:-)
Brick: I’ll never join you and no he won’t. You hurt Gordon. >:-(
N: You’re brainwashed but ok. <:-(

Brick: (claps sarcastically 3 times) I don’t know what Gordon has gotten me into. >:-|
N: See, I knew you’re annoyed with Gordon’s rules. >:-) All you had to say was I was right and you were wrong. <:-)
Brick: Ok N, now go away. |:-|
N: I will say you’re not as annoying as John in terms of admitting your wrongs and everything. :-|
Brick: You think I’m less annoying than John. <:-(
N: Yes, dude calls me Packard like he does not know my name or what. >:-(
Brick: Yeah, well I don’t know why he does that but ignore it. Even his smoking habits are insane, I tell him to stop, he doesn’t. /:-(
